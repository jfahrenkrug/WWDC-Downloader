# WWDC 2014 Sample Code Downloader

![First World WWDC Sample Code Problem](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/21928207.jpg)

## Sad days are over

This script will download all the session material for you if you are a WWDC 2014 attendee OR NOT! This year you only need to have an Apple Developer account, that's it!
You can now simply install WWDC-Downloader as a ruby gem like this:

    gem install wwdcdownloader --no-rdoc --no-ri

or

    sudo gem install wwdcdownloader --no-rdoc --no-ri

Run the script like this: 

    wwdcdownloader <your Apple ID> [<target-dir>]

The script will create a directory called "wwdc2014-assets" (or `target-dir` if given) in the directory you run the script from.

That's it. Enjoy and see you next year.
