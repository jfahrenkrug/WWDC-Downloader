# WWDC 2018 Sample Code Downloader

This script will download all the WWDC 2018 sample code.
You can simply install WWDC-Downloader as a ruby gem like this:

    gem install wwdcdownloader

or

    sudo gem install wwdcdownloader

Run the script like this:

    wwdcdownloader [<target-dir>]

The script will create a directory called "wwdc2018-assets" (or `target-dir` if given) in the directory you run the script from.

That's it. Enjoy and see you next year.
